## Introduction 

In this notebook, we are reverse engineering the story, [Over a Dozen Black and Latino Men Accused a Cop of Humiliating, Invasive Strip Searches. The NYPD Kept Promoting Him.](https://www.propublica.org/article/over-a-dozen-black-and-latino-men-accused-a-cop-of-humiliating-invasive-strip-searches-the-nypd-kept-promoting-him)

## Load and Cleaning Data

In this section, describe the source of the data, write a basic data dictionary for data you are working with, and discuss any caveats or issues you discovered working with this data. 

```{r}
# Load required data

# Path to data should be loaded from folder "data" i.e. read_csv("data/name_of_data.csv")

# Clean required data and prepare for analysis if needed. 


```

## Sentences to Engineer
In this notebook, we are reverse engineering five sentences from the story.

### Sentence 1

* **Sentence text**: “A dozen of those high-ranking officers have three or more complaints with substantiated allegations; 10 are white. Five have reached the rank of deputy inspector, the lowest promoted at the commissioner’s discretion; all are white.”

* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 2

* **Sentence text**: “Eighty-six of the roughly 420 officers in the department who currently hold a rank above captain — running precincts and other large commands and overseeing hundreds of officers — have tallied at least one misconduct allegation that was substantiated by the CCRB, meaning that investigators amassed enough evidence of offenses, ranging from bad language to pistol whippings, to say that they happened and broke patrol guidelines. The most common involved improper property entries and searches.”

* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 3

* **Sentence text**: “Of at least 77 allegations made against him in 26 separate CCRB complaints, 29 were unsubstantiated; five were “unfounded,” meaning investigators concluded the incident never took place; and 27 were “exonerated,” meaning the conduct fell within patrol guidelines.”

* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 4

* **Sentence text**: “But many of the officers also said that it’s possible to be an effective cop without so many complaints. An overwhelming majority of the city’s 36,000 officers do not have a single substantiated complaint on their records; only 1 in 9 does.”

* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 5

* **Sentence text**: There isn't really a sentence from the story, but I'd like you to answer this question: The story focused on Christopher McCormack. Use data analysis to justify that decision. Why does he stand out as newsworthy, from all of the people they could have selected? Why, do you think, did the reporters single him out for an in-depth story. Write code to support your argument.

* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

# Display results of code below this codeblock
